# INVENTORY-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD

# 📊 Overview

In fast-moving businesses, data rarely sits still, in actual systems change, databases migrate, and reporting needs evolve.
This project was built to handle exactly that: moving from a **SQL Server test environment** to a **MySQL production environment** while ensuring **data integrity, reliability, and speed**.

---

## 🌟 Real-World Problem
- Reporting pipelines were **slow and inconsistent**, making it hard for managers to react to shortages.
- Data source shift from **SQL Server → MySQL** risked breaking reports unless migration was handled carefully.
- Decision-makers needed **one reliable dashboard** to monitor demand, availability, shortages, and financial impact.

## 📈 KPI Dashboards

### 🔹 Page 1 – Operational KPIs
- **Average Demand per Day**
- **Average Availability per Day**
- **Total Supply Shortage**

### 🔹 Page 2 – Financial KPIs
- **Total Profit**
- **Total Loss**
- **Average Daily Loss**

Together, these dashboards gave stakeholders both the **operational view** (stock movement, shortages) and the **financial view** (profits safeguarded, losses avoided).

## 🔑 What I Delivered
- **Database migration**: From SQL Server (test) to MySQL (production), ensuring **99.9% accuracy** in reporting.
- **Power BI dashboards**: Designed interactive reports with **advanced DAX**, cutting reporting latency by **40%**.
- **Business outcomes**:
- Monitored **61K+ supply shortages**
- Flagged **$8M potential losses early**
- Enabled actions that protected **$301K in profits**

## 💡 Impact
This wasn’t just a data viz exercise, it was about **making reporting resilient to system changes** and ensuring leaders always had a **single source of truth**.
By bridging test and production environments seamlessly, the dashboard became a **live control tower for inventory and financial decisions**.
